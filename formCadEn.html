            <p>The "Club Pets&Pets" project aims to explore input fields through a registration form. The types of inputs used here are checkbox, date, email, file, number, password, radio, range, submit, tel, and text, accompanied by textarea and select. In this project, I kept the layout as simple as possible, focusing on the form, but still bringing a more fun appearance with the choice of colors and the background with illustrations of pets.</p>
            <p>Regarding responsiveness, I used flexbox a lot so that the form adapts to any screen size, dispensing the use of @media. The fonts use the "em" measurement unit to adapt to the user's preferences. Taking into account usability, I separated the registration areas by color, so the user does not get confused when they should enter the pet's data or their own data.</p>
